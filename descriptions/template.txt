The hammer strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 every 6 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 13th level. The base crushing damage inflicted when the hammer scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, 1d4+1.

The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However, the target receives all the penalties for 5 Strength, such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.

These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.

The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However, the target receives all the penalties for 5 Strength, such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.

Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).

These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.
